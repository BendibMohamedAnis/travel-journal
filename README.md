# travel-journal
Travel Journal is a web application that I created using React, which enables users to save their travel notes with pictures and relevant information. With the increasing number of travel enthusiasts around the world, this application is designed to help people keep track of their travel experiences and share them with others.

With Travel Journal, users can create a new trip by adding details such as the trip location, date, and a brief description. Users can also add photos to their trip to capture the beautiful moments and memories they made during their travels. The application allows users to organize their trips by tagging them with relevant keywords, making it easier to search and filter through the saved trips.

The user-friendly interface of the application allows users to easily navigate and interact with their saved trips. Users can view their saved trips, edit the details, and add new photos and notes anytime they want. The application also provides an option to share their trips with friends and family through various social media platforms.

Overall, Travel Journal is a great tool for travel enthusiasts to record their experiences and share them with others. It provides an easy-to-use platform for users to document their travels, making it a perfect companion for any avid traveler.

## Showcase

![showcase](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46926963/208295970-e3f4500c-f1d1-4d6c-9415-64decc339d9f.png)



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!



### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
